How to Contribute
=================

While I welcome contributions of all shapes and sizes, I also want to
ensure that the source remains in good legal ground, and under
consistent licensing terms. Because of this, I have adopted the
"Developer Certificate of Origin" used by the Linux project.

In order to contribute to this project, you must certify the following,
by adding a "sign-off line to the list of contributors below, using your
real name and email address. (Please use the same email that you use
with git and to submit contributions.)

Note that you do not have to add an additional sign-off line to the
commit message, because that is awkward to do with GitHub currently.

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.
